(promising are Neural Network models)

(3 types of learning)
1. Unsupervised Learning (unlabelled data -- algorithm finds pattern)
    1. Clustering (similarity in data)
    2. Association (understand rules and meaning behind different groups)
2. Supervised Learning (labelled data -- also based on feedback from unsupervised learning)
    1. Regression (predict continuous values)
    2. Classification (yes or no type answers)
3. Reinforcement Learning (reward / penalty based system -- iterative steps, learn series of actions, learns continuously)
